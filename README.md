# Vexularg

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

B1T Jam, December 2025, theme "OFFERING".

Dot and Moon want to summon the dread ghoul Vexularg.
To do so, they'll need to gather a suitable offering.
Metroidvaniy fetch quest. Explore, find things, bring them back to the altar.
Time limit.

Pick things up with B, a la Sitter.
Include offerable items that also do things: trampoline, magnet, fan.
Maybe a TV to distract the murderous bat?
Make a murderous bat.

I'm thinking one giant map.

Don't generalize sprite groups like I did for Queen of Clocks, it's overkill.
Single list of live sprites, which we'll iterate the whole thing a lot. It's OK. Chill.

One tilesheet for terrain and one for sprites. Try not to need more.
